Lubuntu is a fast, lightweight, and energy-saving spin of Ubuntu using the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment (LXDE). It comes with all the applications needed for daily use, while keeping your system light and responsive, making it ideal not only for old computers and netbooks, but for making newer computers lightening fast.
