Kali Linux is not a general-purpose distribution, instead it is focused on being a digital forensics and penetration testing resource for ethical hackers and cybersecurity experts. Out-of-the-box Kali comes pre-loaded with a number of tools designed for information gathering, determining software vulnerabilities and exploits, monitoring and whole bunch more required for security auditing.
