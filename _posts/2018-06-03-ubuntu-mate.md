Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use Linux distribution based on Ubuntu that makes use of the configurable MATE desktop environment. It is ideal for those who want the most out of their computers and prefer a traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for modern workstations, single board computers and older hardware alike.
