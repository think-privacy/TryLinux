As one of the oldest free software operating systems, Debian is reknowned for its stability &amp; reliability. However given its complex development cycle, it is infrequently updated and a tendency to lag behind the competition in terms providing the latest and greatest software.

The Debian Project holds a steadfast adherence to Free Software, distributing Debian in accordance with the principles of the [GNU Project](http://www.gnu.org/) and has produced a strict [social contact](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) and set of [Free Software guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) to guide the development of Debian and inform its many contributors.

While the default desktop environment of Debian is [GNOME](/desktops/gnome), during installation you can pull from Debian's vast software respository of over 50000 packages to install virtually any other.
