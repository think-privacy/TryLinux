Manjaro is a user-friendly GNU/Linux distribution based on the independently developed Arch Linux. While Manjaro is a rolling release system, they periodically updated their ISO to offer the most recent updates and tweaks and release this under a version number. Unlike Arch Linux, Manjaro holds back immediate (non-security) updates for testing.
