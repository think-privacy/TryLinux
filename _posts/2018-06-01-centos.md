CentOS Stream is a free of cost distro that tracks just ahead of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) development, positioned as a midstream between Fedora Linux and RHEL. Created as an alternative to CentOS when it reached end-of-life, and originally to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the project is a community-driven effort focused on delivering a robust open source ecosystem. It offers consistent manageable platform that suits a wide variety of needs along with extensive resources to build, test, release, and maintain code.
