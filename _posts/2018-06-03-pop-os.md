Pop!_OS is a Linux distribution developed by computer manufacturer system76 Inc. for their products, but is available for general use. The whole operating system and user interface is designed to get out of the way and enable developers, makers, and people whose jobs are best served by the tools available on Linux to get things done.

Pop!_OS is also one of the few distributions to enable full disk encryption by default to secure your device from the start.
