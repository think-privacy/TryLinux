Trisquel is a 100% free software GNU/Linux operating system, meaning it comes with no proprietary software, a distinction that gained it an endorsement from the [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org/) as a entirely "free as in freedom" distribution. 

Trisquel comes with a complete selection of programs that can be easily extended using a graphical installer. There are several editions available, including a "mini" edition for netbooks and old computers.
