MATE is a desktop environment that uses a "traditional" desktop metaphor, that is one of windows, taskbars and panels with menus. Historically, the MATE project started as a continuation of a legacy version of the [GNOME desktop environment](/desktops/gnome) after that project's interface shifted to a more abstract one that uses an overview instead of using a panel to manage tasks.
