The GNOME desktop environment has been designed to deliver a consistent and integrated experience, resulting in a smooth and polished product that is satisfying to use.

A key feature of GNOME is the "Activities Overview", which is way to view open your open applications or launch new ones. Everything is in one place and a powerful search function lets you find documents, new applications or even information from the web.
