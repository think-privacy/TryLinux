<h2>What is "Linux"?</h2>
</section>

<section>
<p>Though Linux is best known as server or infrastructure operating system, it also exists as a free and open source alternative to Apple macOS and Microsoft Windows for use on everyday computers, such as laptop and desktop PCs, and like these operating systems Linux is available with a graphical user interface and other software you are accustomed to using.</p>

	<p>However to be "free and open source" means adopting not just a different development process but a whole set of core principles that differs from proprietary software (as found in operating systems like Apple's macOS, Microsoft Windows and others). To be "open source" means to develop completely openly&mdash;all source code is freely available to the public so that to anyone can view, edit or contribute to it&mdash;and "free" here refers not to the cost of the software but to its liberty&mdash;as no one entity owns the software it essentially belongs to everyone, without restriction.</p>
	<p>So, in part, making the switch to Linux is an ethical decision about the software you use on a daily basis, and the rights you and others have to the information and things you use.</p>
